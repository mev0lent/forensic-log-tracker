# Forensic Log Tracker

> A modular, secure CLI tool for forensic professionals and students. Designed to log, document, and digitally sign command outputs during digital forensic investigations.

---

## 🔍 What is this?

**Forensic Log Tracker** is a logging tool built for **Kali Linux** (or any Linux distro), allowing forensic analysts to:
- ✅ Execute system commands and log the output
- ✅ Automatically generate legal explanations for those commands
- ✅ Digitally sign each log with **GPG**
- ✅ Organize cases and maintain chain-of-custody integrity

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/forensic-log-tracker.git
cd forensic-log-tracker
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. (Optional) Generate a GPG key

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### 📁 Create a new case

```bash
python cli.py new-case case001 --description "Investigating suspicious USB stick"
```

### ▶️ Run a command inside a case

```bash
python cli.py run "strings /bin/ls" --case case001
```

This creates:
- A signed `.log` file in `logs/case001/`
- A `.sig` file with the detached GPG signature

### 🔍 Analyze the case folder

```bash
python cli.py analyze --case case001
```

### 📂 List all existing cases

```bash
python cli.py list-cases
```

### 📋 Show case description

```bash
python cli.py case-info --case case001
```

---

## 🧾 Example Log Output

```markdown
# 🕒 2025-04-17T14:52:33Z
## 🧪 Case: case001

### 🧩 Command:
`strings /bin/ls`

### 📤 Output (Excerpt):
```
ELF
GNU
/bin/sh
```

### 🧾 Legal Explanation:
The `strings` tool was used to extract printable characters from a binary. This helps identify human-readable data such as paths, passwords, or configs without altering evidence.

### 🔐 SHA256 Output Hash:
`a6f7...d3`
```

## 🔐 About GPG Signing

All logs generated by this tool are optionally signed using [GnuPG (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/). This ensures:

- ✅ The log file has **not been modified** since creation
- ✅ The log was created by someone with access to the **private key**
- ✅ The digital signature can be **independently verified** by others

### 🔐 Why GPG instead of just SHA256?

| Method     | What it proves                            | Forensically valid? |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| SHA256     | File integrity (unchanged content)        | ⚠️ Can be spoofed    |
| GPG (used) | Integrity **and** authorship (via key)     | ✅ Recommended        |

> Logs are signed using **detached signatures** stored as `.log.sig` files.

### 🧰 How to generate a GPG key (if you don’t have one):

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Choose:
- Key type: `RSA and RSA`
- Key size: `4096 bits`
- Expiry: `0` (no expiration)
- Name/email (can be fake if used offline)

Once generated, you can view your key with:

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

---

## 🔐 Verifying Signatures

To verify that a `.log` file was signed by a trusted GPG key and hasn't been altered:

```bash
gpg --verify logs/case001/2025-04-17T14-52-33_command.log.sig
```

✅ If the file is unchanged and signed correctly, you'll see something like:

```
gpg: Signature made ...
gpg: Good signature from "Your Name <email@example.com>"
```

❌ If the log was changed or the signature is missing/invalid:

```
gpg: BAD signature
```

> You can also export your public key and share it with reviewers or store it alongside your case folder.
